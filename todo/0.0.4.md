## VFG
- [ ] Variable Flow Graph (VFG) in the form of a Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- [ ] Simple non-DSA/SA constraint analysis in the VFG
- [ ] Write test cases for VFG generation
- [ ] Make sure the VFG represents the if statements and interproc stuff

- [ ] Make a function to recieve a given variable/taintedloc and make the tainted bingoggles object (taintedvar, taintedstructmember, ...)
    - this will remove a ton of redundant code and what not

- [] Make a tracking option for tainted offsets of variables (TaintedVarOffset)
    - will need to make a get_mlil_tainted_var_offset_refs or something
