- [x] Write valid assertions in test/test_cases.py
- [x] Improve the function to account for more SSA MLIL operations
- [x] Rename vfa.py to bg.py for clarity
- [x] Fix `get_struct_field_name` to handle nested field names
- [x] Add a Target class for defining analysis targets
- [X] Add support for imported functions
  - [X] Integrate imported function taint analysis into engine
  - [ ] Memoize results still trying to find out how to serialize it effectively, this is really useful for things like when your analyzing many binaries and they all use the same libc or something.
  - NOTE: Must have the user supply a complete dependencies for example a library may import other libraries that must be resolved.
  - Ideally I want this to be an automated system, having the user manually supply a dependency graph is kind of a pita.
  - [ ] Make a table for abstracting a ton of the libc write functions such as strcpy, memcpy and others that taint other arguments or return variables.
    - make this on by default but make it optionally
